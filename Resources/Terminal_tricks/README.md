# Terminal tricks
In CTF's, we should know a lot, a lot of ways how to acces the same thing. Sometimes one functionality is blocked, sometimes some commands are missing and so on. These get really annoying and you can never figure out what to use. This folder contains a lot of tips and tricks you can use around if one or the other functionalities are blocked.

**Note:**
