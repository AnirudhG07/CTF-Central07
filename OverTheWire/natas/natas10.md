# natas10

Since we have restrictions this time, we cannot try anything particular. But then we can output everything right! So we run
```bash
.*
```
This will print out everything that is there. But we yet didnt get our password. So we give the location we want as-
```bash
.* /etc/natas_webpass/natas11
```
And sure enough we see our password in `/etc/natas_webpass/natas11`.
