# buffer overflow 0
As the name suggests, their would be memory issues. So randomly input a big number like `1111111111111111111` and you will get the flag. How easy is that! No need to look at the source code.

## NOTE 
This was luck, this will probably never happen in any other CTF. So don't get used to it.
