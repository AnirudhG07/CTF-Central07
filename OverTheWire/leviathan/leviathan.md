# leviathan
leviathan is a wargame from OverTheWire based on Web Exploitatioin. The link is https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/

# Rules
1. Password for leviathan0 is leviathan0
2. Find password for next leviathan level within the current level.
3. Next machine level is (example) http://leviathan5.leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/, just change 5 to 6, etc.
4. You can access the password to leviathan1 if you are inside the level leviathan 1 at `/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan1`.

**NOTE:** The password may differ for each user but the mathod remains same. Thus these are just the solutions, passwords will not be mentioned.

## Passwords list(For me)
* leviathan0 - leviathan0
* leviathan1 - 3QJ3TgzHDq
* leviathan2 - NsN1HwFoyN
* leviathan3 - f0n8h2iWLP
* leviathan4 - WG1egElCvO
* leviathan5 - 0dyxT7F4QD
* leviathan6 - szo7HDB88w

That's all for leviathan. It was very easy and fun!
