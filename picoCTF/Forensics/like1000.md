This is a series of decompressions of tars you have to do. So we write a code to automate the process and get the flag. We break if filler to text contains `picoCTF`.
```python
import tarfile
import os

def check_file_for_flag(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        if 'picoCTF' in f.read():
            return True
    return False

for i in range(999, 0, -1):
    tar_filename = f'{i}.tar'
    if os.path.exists(tar_filename):
        with tarfile.open(tar_filename) as tar:
            tar.extractall()
        if check_file_for_flag('filler.txt'):
            print('Flag found in filler.txt')
            break
```
Though we do not get the flag in `filler.txt` but we get a `flag.png` which is in the last tar file which has the flag written on it. And we are done

### Flag
```
picoCTF{l0t5_0f_TAR5}
```
