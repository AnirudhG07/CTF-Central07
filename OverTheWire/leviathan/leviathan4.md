This problem is very easy. You simply perform the following steps and get the result-
1. Check the files in main directory using `ll`. This shows you that you have `.trash` directory.
2. Inside `.trash`, you have `bin` file, which is binary.
3. When you run the file using `./bin` command, you get a list of binary numbers.
In my case it was-
```
00110000 01100100 01111001 01111000 01010100 00110111 01000110 00110100 01010001 01000100 00001010
```
4. Convert these binaries to text using some online tool to get the password.
And you are done!
