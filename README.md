# Commit Summary
The commits have the specific patter(except initial 2-3) -

```
The category will be according to me(unless specified). For some of the ctf's involving hacking a machine which provides multiple categories, then `category=multi` and `miscellenia` will contain the types used. The short forms used for Categories are-
```
General Skill - GenSk
Web Exploitation - WebExp
Binary Exploitation - BinExp
Reverse Engineering - RevEng
Forensics - Frnsic
Cryptography & Cipher - Crypto
(multi/un)categorizes - multi
